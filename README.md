Simple python program to approximate your pitch

## Setup
1. Either download all required packages in the `requirements.txt` globally using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or create a `venv` first to install them locally (reccomended).
2. Make sure that you have a working microphone / headset set as the default microphone of your system
3. Run the `main.py` script which will run you through the process!
